**Welcome to My Library**
This Python script allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user. The program runs in a loop, providing a menu for the user to choose an operation, and continues to prompt the user until they choose to exit.

**Features**
User-friendly Welcome Message: The script begins by welcoming the user to the library.
Input Handling: It prompts the user to input two numbers for the arithmetic operations.
Menu Options: A menu is displayed with four options for the user to choose the desired operation.
Arithmetic Operations:
**Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division** (with error handling for division by zero)
Loop for Multiple Operations: After completing one operation, the user is asked if they want to perform another operation. If the user inputs 'yes', the menu is displayed again; otherwise, the program exits.
